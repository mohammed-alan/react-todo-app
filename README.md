# React To-Do List

A simple, modern To-Do List application built with **React**. This project demonstrates the use of React's core features like functional components and hooks (`useState`) to manage state and create an interactive user experience.

## Features

- Add new tasks to your list
- Delete tasks you’ve completed or no longer want
- Move tasks up or down to prioritize them
- Input validation to prevent empty tasks

---

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Functional components with hooks for state management (`useState`)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For application logic and event handling
- **CSS**: Modern styling with flexbox and hover effects for a clean UI

---

## How It Works

- The app maintains the list of tasks using React’s `useState` hook.
- Adding a task updates the state by appending the new task to the existing list.
- Deleting a task filters it out based on its index.
- Moving tasks up or down swaps tasks in the list by manipulating the array order.
- The UI updates automatically whenever the state changes, thanks to React’s reactivity.
